	<h4>Biography</h4>
	<p>
	Dr. Eric Christian of NASA Headquarters has returned home from Antarctica, a voyage he made to assist in the 2001 and 2003 launches of the balloon-borne instrument, TIGER. He kept the journals below during his visits.Eric was born in New Jersey (or for Joe Piscipo fans: Joisey, Exit 19) in November 1960. Although he had always been interested in math and science, having a great high school Physics teacher really helped him clarify what he was going to be. He met his wife, Christine Gallant, in high school, and they were married in 1984. Eric and his wife have a son and daughter, Stephen and Lyta. No pets at the moment; two children keep them busy enough.
